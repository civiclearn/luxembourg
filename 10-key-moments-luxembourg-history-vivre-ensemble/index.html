  <h2>1. The origins of Luxembourg (10th century)</h2>
  <p>
    Luxembourg began as a small medieval fortress around the year 963.
  </p>
  <p>
    Its strategic location would define its destiny for centuries, placing it at the crossroads
    of major European powers.
  </p>

  <h2>2. Luxembourg under Burgundian and Habsburg rule</h2>
  <p>
    For long periods, Luxembourg was ruled by foreign dynasties.
  </p>
  <p>
    These centuries explain why the country developed a strong sense of resilience and adaptation.
  </p>

  <h2>3. The Congress of Vienna (1815)</h2>
  <p>
    After the Napoleonic Wars, the Congress of Vienna reshaped Europe.
  </p>
  <p>
    Luxembourg became a Grand Duchy and entered a new phase as a recognised political entity.
  </p>

  <h2>4. The Treaty of London (1867)</h2>
  <p>
    This treaty guaranteed Luxembourg’s neutrality and independence.
  </p>
  <p>
    It also led to the dismantling of the fortress, transforming the country’s role in Europe.
  </p>

  <h2>5. The First World War (1914–1918)</h2>
  <p>
    Despite its neutrality, Luxembourg was occupied by Germany.
  </p>
  <p>
    This experience raised questions about neutrality and national sovereignty.
  </p>

  <h2>6. The Second World War (1940–1945)</h2>
  <p>
    The Nazi occupation deeply marked Luxembourgish society.
  </p>
  <p>
    Resistance, forced conscription, and repression remain central to collective memory.
  </p>

  <h2>7. The end of neutrality after 1945</h2>
  <p>
    After the war, Luxembourg abandoned strict neutrality.
  </p>
  <p>
    It chose cooperation and security through international alliances.
  </p>

  <h2>8. European integration</h2>
  <p>
    Luxembourg became a founding member of what is now the European Union.
  </p>
  <p>
    Europe offered stability, influence, and a new framework for cooperation.
  </p>

  <h2>9. Economic transformation in the late 20th century</h2>
  <p>
    The decline of the steel industry forced Luxembourg to reinvent its economy.
  </p>
  <p>
    Finance, services, and innovation gradually replaced heavy industry.
  </p>

  <h2>10. Luxembourg in the 21st century</h2>
  <p>
    Today, Luxembourg is a multicultural, multilingual country with a strong social model.
  </p>
  <p>
    Its history explains its openness, its institutions, and the idea of vivre-ensemble.
  </p>

  <h2>What you should remember for the test</h2>
  <p>
    The Vivre-Ensemble test focuses on understanding, not memorisation.
  </p>
  <p>
    If you can explain how these moments shaped Luxembourg’s values and institutions,
    you are well prepared.
