  <h1>Castles of Luxembourg: Exploring the Grand Duchy’s Medieval Heritage</h1>
   Luxembourg is often called the <strong>“Land of Castles”</strong>, and for good reason—this small country is home to over <strong>100 castles and fortresses</strong>, many of which date back to the <strong>Middle Ages</strong>. These castles not only tell the story of Luxembourg’s <strong>strategic importance</strong> in European history but also remain <strong>well-preserved symbols of its rich heritage</strong>. If you’re preparing for the <strong>Vivre-Ensemble test</strong>, understanding the role of these castles in Luxembourg’s history and culture is essential.
<h3><strong>Why Does Luxembourg Have So Many Castles?</strong></h3>
During the <strong>medieval period</strong>, Luxembourg was a crossroads for trade and military activity, making it a <strong>prime location for fortifications</strong>. The powerful noble families who ruled over different regions built castles to defend their territories, collect tolls, and exert influence over the land.

After the <strong>Treaty of London (1867)</strong>, which declared Luxembourg’s <strong>perpetual neutrality</strong>, many of these fortresses lost their military purpose. Today, they serve as <strong>historical landmarks and cultural attractions</strong>, attracting visitors from all over the world.
