  <h2>The role of laws in Luxembourg</h2>
  <p>
    Laws are the foundation of public life in Luxembourg. They define rights,
    obligations and the organisation of society. Understanding how laws are made
    helps candidates grasp how democracy functions in practice.
  </p>
  <p>
    For the Vivre-Ensemble test, it is important to identify the institutions
    involved in the legislative process and their respective roles.
  </p>

  <h2>Who can propose a law?</h2>
  <p>
    In Luxembourg, laws can be proposed either by the government or by members of
    the Chamber of Deputies. Government proposals are called bills, while proposals
    originating from deputies are known as legislative proposals.
  </p>
  <p>
    In practice, most laws are proposed by the government, reflecting its role in
    setting public policy.
  </p>

  <h2>Examination by the Chamber of Deputies</h2>
  <p>
    Once a draft law is submitted, it is examined by the Chamber of Deputies.
    Deputies discuss the text, propose amendments and vote on the final version.
  </p>
  <p>
    This debate phase allows different political opinions to be expressed and
    contributes to democratic decision-making.
  </p>

  <h2>The role of the Council of State</h2>
  <p>
    Before a law is adopted, the Council of State gives its opinion on the draft
    text. It examines the legal quality of the proposal and its conformity with
    the Constitution.
  </p>
  <p>
    Although its opinion is advisory, it plays an important role in improving the
    quality of legislation.
  </p>

  <h2>Promulgation by the Grand Duke</h2>
  <p>
    After adoption by the Chamber of Deputies, the law is promulgated by the Grand
    Duke. Promulgation confirms that the law has been adopted according to the
    Constitution.
  </p>
  <p>
    The law then enters into force after publication.
  </p>

  <h2>Why this process matters for the Vivre-Ensemble test</h2>
  <p>
    Test questions often ask which institutions are involved in making laws and in
    what order. Candidates must clearly distinguish the roles of the government,
    the Chamber of Deputies, the Council of State and the Grand Duke.
  </p>
  <p>
    A clear understanding of this process is essential to succeed in the
    Vivre-Ensemble test.
