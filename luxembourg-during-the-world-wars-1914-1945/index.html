  <h2>Luxembourg and the First World War</h2>
  <p>
    At the outbreak of the First World War in 1914, Luxembourg was a neutral
    country. Despite this neutrality, German troops occupied the country in
    order to facilitate military operations.
  </p>
  <p>
    Although Luxembourg was not a battlefield, the occupation affected daily
    life and challenged the country’s political independence.
  </p>

  <h2>Consequences of the First World War</h2>
  <p>
    After the war, Luxembourg reaffirmed its independence and neutrality. The
    conflict led to political debates about the country’s future and its place
    in Europe.
  </p>
  <p>
    These discussions contributed to the gradual evolution of Luxembourg’s
    political system.
  </p>

  <h2>Luxembourg during the Second World War</h2>
  <p>
    In 1940, during the Second World War, Luxembourg was again invaded and
    occupied by Nazi Germany. This occupation was far more severe than during
    the First World War.
  </p>
  <p>
    The Luxembourg population faced repression, forced conscription and
    attempts to suppress national identity.
  </p>

  <h2>Resistance and exile</h2>
  <p>
    During the occupation, acts of resistance took place within the country.
    The Luxembourg government went into exile and continued to represent the
    country abroad.
  </p>
  <p>
    These efforts helped preserve Luxembourg’s sovereignty and international
    recognition.
  </p>

  <h2>Liberation and lessons learned</h2>
  <p>
    Luxembourg was liberated in 1944–1945. The experience of the Second World
    War had a profound impact on the country’s commitment to democracy, human
    rights and international cooperation.
  </p>
  <p>
    After the war, Luxembourg became an active supporter of European
    integration.
  </p>

  <h2>Why this period matters for the Vivre-Ensemble test</h2>
  <p>
    The test Vivre-Ensemble includes questions on Luxembourg’s experiences
    during the World Wars and their consequences.
  </p>
  <p>
    Candidates should understand how these events shaped the country’s modern
    values and political choices.
