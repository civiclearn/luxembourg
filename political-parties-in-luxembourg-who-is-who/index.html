  <h2>The role of political parties in a democracy</h2>
  <p>
    Political parties are essential actors in democratic systems. They represent
    different political ideas and propose policies to voters during elections.
  </p>
  <p>
    In Luxembourg, political parties structure political debate and play a key
    role in the functioning of institutions, which is why they are included in
    the Vivre-Ensemble programme.
  </p>

  <h2>The main political parties in Luxembourg</h2>
  <p>
    Luxembourg has several political parties represented in the Chamber of
    Deputies. These parties cover a broad political spectrum, from centre-right
    to left-wing and environmental movements.
  </p>
  <p>
    The presence of multiple parties reflects the diversity of political opinions
    within Luxembourg society.
  </p>

  <h2>Parties and elections</h2>
  <p>
    Political parties present lists of candidates during elections. Citizens vote
    for parties and candidates whose ideas best match their views.
  </p>
  <p>
    The results of elections determine how many seats each party holds in the
    Chamber of Deputies.
  </p>

  <h2>Parties and government formation</h2>
  <p>
    After elections, political parties may form coalitions to create a majority
    in parliament. The parties in the majority typically form the government.
  </p>
  <p>
    Coalition governments are common in Luxembourg and require cooperation
    between parties.
  </p>

  <h2>Opposition parties</h2>
  <p>
    Parties that are not part of the government form the opposition. They play an
    important role by questioning government actions and proposing alternatives.
  </p>
  <p>
    This balance between government and opposition strengthens democratic
    oversight.
  </p>

  <h2>Why political parties matter for the Vivre-Ensemble test</h2>
  <p>
    Test questions may ask about the role of political parties, their participation
    in elections, and their influence on government formation.
  </p>
  <p>
    Candidates should understand that political parties are central to the
    democratic process in Luxembourg.
