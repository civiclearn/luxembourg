  <h2>The Chamber of Deputies in the political system</h2>
  <p>
    The Chamber of Deputies is the parliament of Luxembourg. It exercises the
    legislative power, meaning that it debates, amends and adopts the laws of
    the country.
  </p>
  <p>
    For candidates preparing the Vivre-Ensemble test, it is crucial to identify
    the Chamber of Deputies as the main elected body representing the population.
  </p>

  <h2>Composition of the Chamber of Deputies</h2>
  <p>
    The Chamber of Deputies is composed of deputies elected by universal suffrage.
    Elections take place at regular intervals, and citizens vote to choose their
    representatives.
  </p>
  <p>
    Deputies belong to different political parties and represent various
    political views present in Luxembourg society.
  </p>

  <h2>Legislative functions</h2>
  <p>
    One of the main functions of the Chamber of Deputies is to examine draft laws,
    known as bills. These bills are often proposed by the government, but they are
    discussed, modified and voted on by the deputies.
  </p>
  <p>
    Once a law is adopted by the Chamber, it is promulgated by the Grand Duke and
    then enters into force.
  </p>

  <h2>Control of the government</h2>
  <p>
    The Chamber of Deputies also exercises control over the government. Deputies
    can question ministers, request explanations and debate government policies.
  </p>
  <p>
    This control function ensures transparency and accountability, which are key
    principles of a democratic state and often tested in the Vivre-Ensemble exam.
  </p>

  <h2>The Chamber of Deputies and democracy</h2>
  <p>
    Through elections and parliamentary debates, the Chamber of Deputies reflects
    the will of the people. It plays a central role in balancing power between the
    executive and legislative branches.
  </p>
  <p>
    Understanding this balance helps candidates explain how Luxembourg functions
    as a constitutional monarchy with democratic institutions.
  </p>

  <h2>Why this topic is important for the Vivre-Ensemble test</h2>
  <p>
    Questions often focus on identifying which institution adopts laws, how
    deputies are elected, and how the Chamber controls the government.
  </p>
  <p>
    Candidates should clearly distinguish the role of the Chamber of Deputies
    from that of the government and the Grand Duke.
  </p>
