  <h2>Luxembourg as a constitutional monarchy</h2>
  <p>
    Luxembourg is a constitutional monarchy. This means that the country has a monarch as head of
    state, but political power is exercised according to the Constitution and democratic principles.
    The Grand Duke embodies the continuity of the state, while day-to-day political power is exercised
    by elected institutions.
  </p>
  <p>
    For candidates preparing the Vivre-Ensemble test, it is important to understand that the Grand
    Duke does not govern alone. His role is defined and limited by the Constitution.
  </p>

  <h2>The Grand Duke as head of state</h2>
  <p>
    The Grand Duke of Luxembourg is the head of state. He represents the country nationally and
    internationally and symbolizes national unity. His position is hereditary and regulated by the
    Constitution.
  </p>
  <p>
    Although the Grand Duke holds an important symbolic role, he does not act independently of the
    other institutions. His actions are framed by constitutional rules and political responsibility.
  </p>

  <h2>Constitutional powers of the Grand Duke</h2>
  <p>
    The Constitution grants the Grand Duke several formal powers. These include promulgating laws,
    appointing the government, and representing Luxembourg in international relations.
  </p>
  <p>
    Laws adopted by the Chamber of Deputies enter into force only after they are promulgated by the
    Grand Duke. However, this does not mean that he decides which laws are adopted. Legislative power
    belongs to the elected parliament.
  </p>

  <h2>The role of the government and countersignature</h2>
  <p>
    In practice, the Grand Duke acts on the advice of the government. Most of his official acts require
    the countersignature of a minister, which means that political responsibility lies with the
    government, not with the monarch.
  </p>
  <p>
    This principle is central to understanding Luxembourg’s political system and frequently appears
    in Vivre-Ensemble questions about separation of powers.
  </p>

  <h2>Limits of the Grand Duke’s power</h2>
  <p>
    The powers of the Grand Duke are limited by the Constitution. He cannot govern without the support
    of the government and the Chamber of Deputies. Political decisions are made by elected
    representatives.
  </p>
  <p>
    This balance ensures that Luxembourg remains a democratic state while maintaining a constitutional
    monarchy.
  </p>

  <h2>Why this matters for the Vivre-Ensemble test</h2>
  <p>
    Candidates must be able to explain the role of the Grand Duke, distinguish symbolic functions from
    political power, and understand how his role fits into the broader institutional framework of
    Luxembourg.
  </p>
  <p>
    Questions often focus on identifying the Grand Duke as head of state and explaining the limits of
    his authority under the Constitution.
