  <h3>Clearing up common misunderstandings</h3>
  <p>
    Many candidates approach the Vivre-Ensemble test with unnecessary fear.
    This usually comes from a misunderstanding of what the test is designed to evaluate.

  <h2>Understanding, not memorisation</h2>
  <p>
    The Vivre-Ensemble test does not reward rote learning.
  </p>
  <p>
    Instead, it checks whether you understand how Luxembourg functions as a democratic,
    pluralistic society governed by the rule of law.
  </p>

  <h2>Knowledge of core institutions</h2>
  <p>
    Candidates are expected to recognise the main institutions of the Luxembourgish state.
  </p>
  <p>
    This includes knowing their basic roles and how they interact, not technical details.
  </p>

  <h2>Respect for fundamental rights</h2>
  <p>
    A central focus of the test is respect for fundamental rights and freedoms.
  </p>
  <p>
    Questions often reflect everyday situations where these rights apply in practice.
  </p>

  <h2>Awareness of civic duties</h2>
  <p>
    Living together in Luxembourg also involves responsibilities.
  </p>
  <p>
    The test checks whether candidates understand basic civic duties such as respecting the law
    and participating in social life.
  </p>

  <h2>Shared values of Luxembourg society</h2>
  <p>
    Equality, tolerance, and respect are not abstract concepts in the test.
  </p>
  <p>
    They appear as guiding principles behind many questions and answer choices.
  </p>

  <h2>The ability to reason in real-life contexts</h2>
  <p>
    Many questions are framed around realistic scenarios.
  </p>
  <p>
    The correct answer is often the one that best reflects common sense within Luxembourg’s
    legal and social framework.
  </p>

  <h2>Historical and European context</h2>
  <p>
    The test assumes a basic understanding of Luxembourg’s history and its European dimension.
  </p>
  <p>
    These elements help explain why institutions and values developed the way they did.
  </p>

  <h2>What the test does NOT evaluate</h2>
  <p>
    It does not measure your personal opinions, political preferences, or cultural background.
  </p>
  <p>
    It also does not assess advanced legal knowledge or academic history skills.
  </p>

  <h2>Why many candidates underestimate themselves</h2>
  <p>
    Candidates often know more than they think.
  </p>
  <p>
    When preparation focuses on understanding rather than fear, results improve significantly.
  </p>

  <h2>The real objective of the test</h2>
  <p>
    The Vivre-Ensemble test ensures that all residents share a common understanding
    of how to live together respectfully within Luxembourg society.
  </p>
  <p>
    It is a tool for inclusion, not exclusion.
